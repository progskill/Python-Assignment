## Project: Build an ATM-like System in Python

### Goal:

The goal of this project is for you to create an ATM-like system that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as depositing money, withdrawing money, checking their balance, and exiting the program. This project will help you solidify your knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, error handling, and user input in Python.

### Requirements:

- Account Creation: Users should be able to create an account by entering their name and initial balance.
- Deposit: The system should allow users to deposit money into their account.
- Withdraw: The system should allow users to withdraw money from their account, but only if there are sufficient funds. If not, display an error message.
- Balance Inquiry: Users should be able to check their current account balance.
- Exit: Allow users to exit the system safely.

### Example Workflow:

````Welcome to Python ATM
1. Create Account
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. Check Balance
5. Exit

#### Enter your choice: 1
Please enter your name: John Doe
Please enter your initial balance: 500

Account created successfully!

##### Enter your choice: 2
Enter deposit amount: 200
KES 200 deposited successfully.

#### Enter your choice: 3
Enter withdrawal amount: 100
KES 100 withdrawn successfully.

Enter your choice: 4
Your current balance is: $600

Enter your choice: 5
Thank you for using Python ATM. Goodbye!```

### Tips:
Think of this as a real-world system: what are the potential errors a user could encounter (e.g., insufficient balance)?
You can add additional features like transaction history or password protection if you want to challenge yourself further!
Good luck, and have fun building your own ATM! ðŸš€
